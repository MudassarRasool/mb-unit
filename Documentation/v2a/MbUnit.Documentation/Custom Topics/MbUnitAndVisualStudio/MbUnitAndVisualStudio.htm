   <h1>
      MbUnit and Visual Studio</h1>
   <p>
      Once you&#8217;ve got the hang of writing tests with MbUnit, running them and debugging
      with them, there are several ways to speed up your test-driven development within
      Visual Studio.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Once you&#8217;ve settled on your preferred way to <a href="../GettingStarted/WritingYourFirstTests.htm#settingupthesolution">
         set up your test-driven solutions</a> be they in <a href="../MbUnitInAnAgileEnvironment/MbUnitInSourceControl.htm">
            source control or not</a>, you could <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/06/01/CodeTemplates/">
               create a reusable project template</a> for your team. There's a good example
         of a simple template <a href="http://blogs.ipona.com/dan/archive/2007/01/02/SimpleTDDVisualStudioTemplates.aspx"
            title="Simple MbUnit VS Template for download">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Likewise, if you find yourself writing the same code time and time again, you might
         like to create your own code snippets for use within Visual Studio. Microsoft has
         <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165392(VS.80).aspx">an official
            guide</a> to creating these here. TechRepublic also has <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-3513-6067392.html">
               a good guide to their creation</a>. We also include a selection of snippets
         with the MbUnit installation. <a href="MbUnitSnippets.htm">Click here for a complete
            rundown of what they do and how to install them</a>.</li>
      <li>One great hassle of using the MbUnit console and GUI runners is that you have to
         leave Visual Studio to use them. Why not have a look at TestDriven.NET, an add-in
         for Visual Studio that lets you execute your tests inside Visual Studio? <a href="MbUnitAndTestDrivenDotNet.htm">
            Find out more here</a>.</li>
      <li>If you already use Resharper, you may be interested to know that there is a freely
         available module for it which enables it to run MbUnit tests. <a href="MbUnitAndResharper.htm">
            Find out more here</a>.</li>
      <li>You can <a href="CreatingSelfTestingAssemblies.htm">create executable self-test
         assemblies with MbUnit</a>.</li>
   </ul>
