   <h1>MbUnit And Resharper</h1>
   <p><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/index.html" title="Resharper home page">Resharper</a> (R#) is a popular add-in for Visual Studio from <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com" title="Jetbrains home page">jetbrains.com</a> that offers built-in code analysis, unit test running and many, many code refactorings at the touch of a right click or keyboard shortcut. By default, the unit test runner that it provides supports only tests written against the nUnit framework. However, in January 2007, <a href="http://der-albert.com">Albert Weinert</a> created <a href="http://der-albert.com/archives/95-Update-zum-MbUnit-PlugIn-fuer-ReSharper.html" title="Details of MbUnit plugin for R# 2.5">a plug-in for Resharper v2.5</a> which adds MbUnit support into the R# test runner. JetBrains have since released R# v3.0. It still doesn&#8217;t support MbUnit out of the box, but Albert has confirmed <a href="http://www.der-albert.com/archives/106-MbUnit-PlugIn-Alpha-for-ReSharper-3.0.1.html">he is working on an update to his plug-in</a> for this new version. This page will be updated when a final version is completed.</p>
