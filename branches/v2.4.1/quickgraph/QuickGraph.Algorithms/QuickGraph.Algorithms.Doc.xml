<remarks name="CyclePoppingRandomTreeAlgorithm">
<para>
This class implements cycle-popping algorithms extracted from Section 6 and 7 of
<em>How to Get Perfectly
Random Sample from a Generic Markov Chain and Generate a Random
Spanning Tree of a Directed Graph.</em>, by James Gary Propp and
 David Bruce Wilson. If you want a deepter understanding of the article,
it is suggested to you have a look at this excellent paper.
</para>
<para>
The class implements two algorithms, namely <em>RandomTreeWithRoot</em>
and <em>RandomTree</em>.
</para>
<para>
These algorithms apply to general digraphs. No strong connectivity is needed.
</para>
<para>
It must be emphasized that this algorithms generates trees where the edges are directe
<b>towards</b> the root.
