      Introduction</h1>
   <p>
      MbUnit is an advanced, extensible unit testing framework originally developed by
      Jonathon &#8216;Peli&#8217; de Halleux and Jamie Cansdale. Peli joined Microsoft in early 2005
      and made it an open source project under the leadership of Andrew Stopford.

   <p>
      From <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/gen/design/gunit.asp">the very start</a>,
      MbUnit&#8217;s aim has been to offer all the features that <a href="http://www.nunit.org">
         nUnit</a> and <a href="http://www.csunit.org">csUnit</a> offer along with the
      extensibility that they do not. MbUnit has been referred to as &#8220;<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MbUnitUnitTestingOnCrack.aspx">unit
         testing on crack</a>&#8221;. It is indeed a Class A unit testing framework. Addiction
      is quite possible :)

      <li>If you&#8217;re new to MbUnit, or to unit testing in general, have a look at <a
         href="GettingStarted/GettingStarted.htm">Getting Started with MbUnit</a>.</li>
      <li>If you&#8217;re getting comfortable with MbUnit, have a look here for ways to <a
         href="MbUnitAndVisualStudio/MbUnitAndVisualStudio.htm">make your developing with
         MbUnit in Visual Studio that much more comfortable</a>.</li>
      <li>If you&#8217;re already working with a different unit testing framework, have a
         look at <a href="MigratingProjects/MigratingProjects.htm">our guides for migrating
            your projects from that one to MbUnit</a>.</li>
      <li>If you&#8217;re looking to incorporate MbUnit into an agile, continuous integration set up, have a look here for <a href="MbUnitInAnAgileEnvironment/MbUnitInAnAgileEnvironment.htm">instructions and suggestions on how to do that</a>.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>And, of course, we have our <a href="API.htm">API reference</a>, detailing the tests, asserts, fixtures, report and extension classes that are the reasons you use MbUnit in the first place. If you&#8217;re new to MbUnit, you can have a look at our <a href="WhatDoYouWantToTest.htm">What Do You Want To Test Today?</a> page which should help you find the type of test that best suits what you need to do.</p>
   <p>Those curious can also browse the source code directly <a href="http://mb-unit.googlecode.com/svn/">on Google Code</a> or via <a href="http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=HKELQ33AUYPNS1EUTL79DDLUWH">koders.com</a>.</p>
