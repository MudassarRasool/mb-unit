   <h1>
      Contributing To MbUnit</h1>
   <p>
      The MbUnit code is currently available <a href="License.htm">under the Apache software
         license</a> and was written by <a href="Contributors.htm">the team</a>. Their
      efforts were made significantly easier by software donations from <a href="ThanksToOurBenefactors.htm">
         several companies and projects</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you&#8217;d like to help us out making MbUnit even better than it already is,
      we&#8217;re always happy to hear from you on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/MbUnitDev">
         MbUnit-Dev google group</a>. We are always looking for people to help with
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>The core test framework</li>
      <li>Our GUI and console based test runners</li>
      <li>MSBuild and NAnt extensions</li>
      <li>Documentation</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
      Check out our Source Code</h2>
   <p>
      If you&#8217;d like to have a look at the MbUnit source code and docs before you
      join the team, you have several options. You can</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Browse the source code directly <a href="http://mb-unit.googlecode.com/svn/">on
         Google Code</a>.</li>
      <li>Browse the source code directly via <a href="http://www.koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=HKELQ33AUYPNS1EUTL79DDLUWH">
         koders.com</a>.</li>
      <li>Check out a read-only working copy anonymously over HTTP with subversion. Use the
         following command
         <br />
         <pre>   svn checkout http://mb-unit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mb-unit</pre>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>
      Coding Guidelines</h2>
   <p>
      At present, we don&#8217;t have a defined set of coding standards or guidelines
      for the project. However</p>
   <ul>
      <li>We do use FxCop (on default settings) for checking code however, so you may want
         to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Team/FxCop/">download</a> that for reference</li>
      <li>We ask that any code you submit, you also <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/02/06/XMLC/">
         document it in the source code</a> as well to keep this documentation set up to
         date.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      We&#8217;ll upload a more formal set of guidelines as they are solidified.
   </p>
   <h2>
      Submitting Patches</h2>
   <p>
      Once you&#8217;ve had a look round the source and fixed a bug or added a new feature
      to your local copy, please submit it as a patch to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/MbUnitDev">
         MbUnit-Dev list</a>. To create a patch for SVN, use the SVN diff command like
      so</p>
   <pre>   svn diff changedfilename > x:\path\to\patchfile.patch</pre>
   <p>
      If you use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">TortoiseSVN</a>, right click
      the files you&#8217;ve altered and choose <em>TortoiseSVN | Create Patch...</em>
      from the context menu.</p>
