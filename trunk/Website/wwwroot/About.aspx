        About MbUnit</h3>
    <p>
        The framework was first created by Jonathan 'Peli' de Halleux as a hobby project
        while studying for his PhD. Later
        Peli and Jamie Cansdale added support for MbUnit
        to Jamie's NUnitAddin (later it would become the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.testdriven.net/"
            onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff;
                text-decoration: underline">TestDriven.NET</span></a> addin).&nbsp; After
        Peli's departure to Microsoft in 2005 (working first as a SDE\T on the CLR and more
        recently in the Foundations
        for Software Engineering group in Microsoft Research)
        the project was opensourced under its currant lead, Andy Stopford. The projects
        regular commit members include Graham
    Hay, Vadim Kreynin, Julian
        Hidalgo, Joey Calisay,&nbsp; Ben Hall, Jeff Brown, Marc Stober and Johan Appelgren.
