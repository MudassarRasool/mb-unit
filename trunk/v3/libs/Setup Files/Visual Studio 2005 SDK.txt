It is possible to install the SDK without Visual Studio.  Here's one way:

1. Install a product that includes the MS Help 2.0 components such as Visual Studio Express,
   SQL Server Express or the MSDN.

2. Install the Windows SDK tools.

3. Download the Visual Studio 2005 SDK.  These instructions were tested with VsSDKFebruary2007.exe.

4. Extract the SDK executable to a temporary folder using a tool such as WinRAR.

5. Run the MSIDb.exe program in %PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin.

   * Open the 'vssdk.msi' file that was extracted in step 4.
   * Export the LaunchConditions to the temporary folder.
   * Edit the LaunchCondition.idt file that was created using a text editor to delete
     the following line:
       (DEVENV_DIR <> "") OR Installed	Visual Studio 2005 SDK can only be installed on machines with Visual Studio 2005 installed.
   * Import the modified LaunchConditions back into the MSI.
   * Quit the MSIDb program.

6. Run the altered 'vssdki.msi' installer.
