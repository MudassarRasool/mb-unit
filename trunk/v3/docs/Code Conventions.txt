Code Conventions for MbUnit.
============================

These are some simple rules to keep in mind so that we can all play nicely
together.  Thanks for your consideration and attention to detail.

CODE STYLE
==========

1. Above all else, try to make the code look consistent!  Though it
   is the product of a community of developers, it should feel like it
   was written by a single (very smart and omniscient) developer.
   Inconsistencies in style make it more difficult for newcomers to
   contribute to the project and produces endless arguments and irritation.
   
   Inconsistent style just looks sloppy.  So keep it beautiful.

2. For the most part, just follow the Microsoft "Design Guidelines for Developing
   Class Libraries" (in MSDN) especially the "Guidelines for Names" section.
   Before you start writing code, please read a bit of it to get a feel for the common
   style being used by everyone else.
   
   Additional notes:
   
   - Do not prefix private member names in any way.
   - Use camel-case for all identifiers including constants.
   - Capitalize type, method, property and constant names.
   - No Hungarian notation.
   - Curly braces on their own lines.
   - Do not write "if" statements all on one line.
   
3. TABs vs Spaces.  I don't care.  Modern editors assume 4 spaces to a tab
   so it looks fine anywhere.  So there!  ;-)
   
4. Please use liberal vertical whitespace to make reading the code easier.
   It's astonishingly helpful to have long functions broken down into
   a series of phases like: validation, processing, and production of
   the final result.

5. Highlight broken, incomplete, tricky, or interesting bits in comments.
   The following prefixes are recommended:
     // FIXME:
     // TODO:
     // NOTE:
   

DOCUMENTATION
=============

1. Apply clear XML documentation comments to all public and protected types
   and members in the MbUnit.Core and MbUnit.Framework namespaces clearly.
   Choosing good identifiers is also important.  These types and members
   are public API and we will generate HTML and CHM documentation from them
   for consumption by testers, developers and system integrators.

   Use <see cref="..." /> and <seealso cref="..." /> liberally to cross-reference
   related concerns.
   
   Use <exception cref="...">...</exception> liberally to document exceptions
   that may reasonably be thrown by a method.
   
   Do not leave empty XML documentation comments.  Strip them out if you
   don't plan to fill them in immediately.  That way we can use the compiler
   so find any missing bits by looking for code 1591 warnings.


LOCALIZATION
============

1. All localizable strings in each Gallio assembly should be moved to resource
   files.  For non-UI projects, this resource file is called "Resources.resx"
   and lives in the Properties folder (and namespace) of the assembly.
   
   Resource strings should be named according to the following pattern based
   on where they are used: "<TypeName>_<Description>".  The <TypeName> should
   be the unqualified type name of the place where the resource string is used.
   The <Description> should be a short descriptive phrase about the contents
   of the resource string, such as the first few words it contains.
 
   Strings that are not to be localized should use the verbatim literal syntax
   with the '@' prefix (like @"foo") to help distinguish them from other strings
   when doing code sweeps.

   Please use the automatically generated typesafe accessors to refer to
   resources whenever possible: they are more robust during refactoring.

   Tip: The RGreatEx plugin for Resharper greatly simplifies moving strings
        into resource files.  It can be configured to automatically
        generate resource keys according to our convention.  Likewise it can
        be configured to suppress suggested string to resource refactorings
        when the string is expressed using the verbatim syntax.
        Using this tool (or something similar) is strongly recommended.

   Caveat: RGreatEx can insert custom #pragma's to mark strings not easily
           represented using '@'.  Do not use this feature.  The non-standard
           pragmas generate compiler warnings and may confuse the uninitiated.
           Instead I've mailed a suggestion to the RGreatEx team to support
           marking non-externalizable strings with // $NON-NLS-x$ style
           comments much like the Eclipse NLS tool.


DEFENSIVE CODING
================

1. Lightly validate all arguments in API functions.  Generally this
   amounts to checking for nulls and basic bounds.  Don't bother
   validating deep structural integrity rules unless the API function
   constitutes a real security hazard.
   
   Also, just use the following pattern for checks at the beginning
   of each function:
   
   if (argument == null)
       throw new ArgumentNullException("argument");
       
   Please don't invent lots of new helpers for checking nullity:
   they are slower than inline code, less intuitive, lead to
   a proliferation of everyone's favority utility functions, and
   don't benefit from special support offered by refactoring
   tools like Resharper or checking by FxCop.


UNIT TESTS
==========

1. Use a consistent naming policy for all unit tests.
   If the class under test is MbUnit.Core.Blah.Foo, then the tests should
   be in MbUnit.Core.Tests.Blah.FooTest.  Integration tests are exempt from
   this rule because they involve many interacting components.  Not
   all unit tests will have a single class under test.  In these cases,
   use good judgement in arranging the tests so that it is still relatively
   straightforward to locate them.


LICENSE BOILERPLATE
===================

1. All code files (except possibly designer generated code) begin with
   the Gallio license boilerplate exactly as contained in the
   CSLicenseBoilerplate.txt file.  This boilerplate can be added
   automatically with the ApplyBoilerplace.bat script.
