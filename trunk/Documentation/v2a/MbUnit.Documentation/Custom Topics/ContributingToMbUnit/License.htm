	<p>License Note</p>

	<p>This license is based on the open source zlib/libpng license. The idea was to keep the license as simple as possible to encourage use of 	MbUnit in free and commercial applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and to give credit to the MbUnit contributors 	for their efforts. While this license allows shipping MbUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a MbUnit variant is the sole purpose of 	your product, please let us know.</p></br>
