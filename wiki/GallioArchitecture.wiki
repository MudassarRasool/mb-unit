== Filters ==

_Code: MbUnit.Framework.Kernel.Filters_

Filters are composable predicates that select a subset of a test or template tree based on associated metadata.

Filters are greedy.  When a filter matches a test or template, it also matches the entire subtree below it and the entire chain of ancestors leading up to the root.  Therefore to create a filter to match a particular test fixture and its ancestors, all of the tests within the fixture will automatically be selected.  Therefore to select some tests but not others, we must construct a composite filter that only matches certain children.

Built-in filter types:
  * And combinator
  * Or combinator
  * Not combinator
  * By assembly
  * By namespace
  * By type
  * By member
  * By id
  * By metadata
