#summary A project wish list.

= Wish List =

There are numerous projects that would be very interesting to consider but that are not currently on the [RoadMap road map].  These projects might make interesting third-party contributions: some could even become commercial products.

If you are interested in pursuing these projects with us or on your own, please let us know!

  * A Gallio or MbUnit v3 book.
  * Gallio-Lite profile for use inside constrained runtime environments.
  * Distributed test execution, monitoring and coordination.
  * Parallel unit test execution.
  * Yora, a WPF-based GUI.
  * An instrumentation toolkit for profiling, mocking and monitoring.
  * A test case management or test workbench for Gallio.
  * Support FIT-style fixtures.
  * Commercial partnership opportunities within the community.

_Feel free to add your own wish-list items at the end of the list here.  You can also post them as feature requests in the issue tracker._
