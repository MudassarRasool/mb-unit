#summary Build instructions.

== Command-Line Builds ==

To build all projects, run the unit tests, and place the binaries in a freshly cleaned _build_ folder in the project root directory, just run the build script:
{{{
Build.bat
}}}

To do all of the the above, plus generate documentation and the installer, run the release build script: (see note below)
{{{
Release.bat
}}}

_Of course, you can also run the Build.msbuild MSBuild project directly if you prefer._

== Specifying Version Numbers ==

To specify a particular version number for the build we need to define the $(Version) property of the MSBuild scripts, like this:

{{{
Release.bat /p:Version=3.0.0.0
}}}

_If no version is specified, then a default of 0.0.0.0 will be used._

== Required Tools for the Release Build ==

The release build requires a few additional tools to be installed.  Some of the tools are distributes in the _libs\Setup Files_ folder of the source tree.  Others must be downloaded.
