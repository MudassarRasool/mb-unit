	/// <para>
	/// All objects which are marshalled by reference
	/// and whose lifetime is manually controlled by
	/// the app, should derive from this class rather
	/// than MarshalByRefObject.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This includes the remote test domain objects
	/// which are accessed by the client and those
	/// client objects which are called back by the
	/// remote test domain.
    /// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Objects in this category that already inherit
	/// from some other class (e.g. from TextWriter)
	/// which in turn inherits from MarshalByRef object 
	/// should override InitializeLifetimeService to 
	/// return null to obtain the same effect.
	/// </para>
