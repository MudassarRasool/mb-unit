<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p></p>
<P>Unit testing is a great tool for ensuring an application quality 
	and&nbsp;frameworks like NUnit [1]&nbsp;or csUnit [2]&nbsp;have made it very 
	simple to implement. However, as the number of tests begins to grow, the need 
	for more functionalities begin to show up.&nbsp;The above frameworks&nbsp;are 
	based on the Simple Test Pattern&nbsp;which is basically the sequence 
	of&nbsp;SetUp, Test, TearDown actions. Although highly generic, this solution 
	lets a lot of work to be done by the test writer. Sadely, there is no easy way 
	to derive and include a new "fixture" type in those frameworks.</P>
<P>Recently, Marc Clifton has proposed more that twenty unit test patterns in [3] 
	that formalizes unit testing.&nbsp;In a perfect world, each of 
	these&nbsp;pattern&nbsp;would have&nbsp;a "specialized" fixture: testing a 
	collection should not require rewritting the test class for each collection 
	instance, this is what I thought after reading Marc's article, the next thought 
	was "let's do it".</P>
<P>While enjoying my stay in hospital for surgery, I spend the time&nbsp;writing a 
	new generative test unit framework called&nbsp;<STRONG>GUnit</STRONG>. The 
	objective of the framework is give the developers the "high order" test 
	fixtures and the tools to build them, to build new custom fixtures without 
	modifying the Core.&nbsp;GUnit already provides new fixture types,&nbsp;like 
	the usefull&nbsp;TypeFixture which applies tests to a particular type instance. <EM>
		It must emphasize that GUnit is still a prototype, was written under the 
		influence of morphine and other substance,&nbsp;and is published on the 
		CodeProject to get <STRONG>constructive</STRONG> feedback, from CPians and 
		specially from members of the AUT project. </EM>
</P>
<P>In the following, it is assumed that the reader has basic knownledge of unit 
	tests (NUnit, csUnit, JUnit)..</P>
<H2>A&nbsp;simple example</H2>
<P>In this example, we show the motivation for GUnit and the key features about it. 
	Exploring the example, we show what kind of data-structure and how the core 
	will be built.</P>
<H3>Simple Test Pattern</H3>
<P>Let us consider the <STRONG>Simple Test Pattern</STRONG>&nbsp;which is 
	implemented by most test unit framework available. This is the classic way of 
	writing unit test as describe in the figure below. <code>TestFixture</code> tags 
	the class, one <code>SetUp</code> method, tests are done in the <code>Test</code>
	tagged method and clean up is performed in <code>TearDown</code> tagged method. 
	This is illustrated in the left of the figure.
</P>
<P>The figure already illustrates one of the key idea of GUnit: Fixture 
	class&nbsp;should be definable at runtime by creating an execution pipe, using 
	basic building blocks (SetUpAttribute, TestAttribute, etc...)&nbsp;provided by 
	the framework.</P>
<p></p>
<p align="center"><IMG alt="Test Pattern" src="pattern.png"></p>
<P>In the above example, we call the TestFixture class a TestFixturePattern, SetUp 
	and TearDown are NonTestPattern tags for&nbsp;mehods that are not considered as 
	tests. Test is a TestPattern. A TestFixturePattern must be able to describe 
	itself at runtime and return it's execution path.</P>
<H2>Defining the TestFixture attribute in GUnit</H2>
<P>As mentionned in the introduction, GUnit provides basic building blocks that 
	developer can use to build more complex fixtures. For example, the Simple Test 
	pattern is implemented as follows in GUnit (source first, comment below)
</P>
<pre lang="cs">public class TestFixtureAttribute : TestFixturePatternAttribute 
{
     public override IRun GetRun()
     {
          SequenceRun runs = new SequenceRun();
			
          // setup
          OptionalMethodRun setup = new OptionalMethodRun(typeof(SetUpAttribute),false);
          runs.Runs.Add( setup );
			
          // tests
          MethodRun test = new MethodRun(typeof(TestPatternAttribute),true,true);
          runs.Runs.Add(test);
			
          // tear down
          OptionalMethodRun tearDown = new OptionalMethodRun(typeof(TearDownAttribute),false);
          runs.Runs.Add(tearDown);
			
          return runs;						
     }
}
</pre>
<P>where</P>
<UL>
	<LI>
	TestFixturePatternAttribute is the abstract&nbsp;base class for all new fixture 
	attribute in GUnit,
	<LI>
	the GetRun method is called by the GUnit core to know what is the execution 
	path of the fixture. The fixture can use built-in basic attribute to build it's 
	execution path.
	<LI>
	An IRun instance can represent the call to a method, or to a sequence of 
	methods, etc...
	<LI>
	SequenceRun is a sequence of runs,
	<LI>
	MethodRun is a IRun instance that wraps a call to a method.tagged by a 
	predefined attribute.
	<LI>
		OptionalMethodRun is inherited from MethodRun and described optional methods.</LI></UL>
<H2>Tagging a class and scanning the test class</H2>
<P>When you provide test assembly to the framework, it will scan for fixture test 
	class. In this case, we wrote one for TestFixture.</P>
<P>Once the fixture is extracted, the framework calls GetRun() method and starts to 
	explore the execution path.</P>
<P>The figure below show the different execution routes that are possible in the 
	ClassicTest class. The two test method generate to branch in the execution 
	tree.</P>
<p></p>
<P align="center"><IMG alt="Fixture" src="fixture.png"></P>
<H2 align="justify">Method decorators</H2>
<P align="justify">It is also possible to add "method call" decorators like 
	ExpectedException, which checks that an exeception is thrown:</P>
<pre lang="cs">...
   [Test]
   [ExpectedException(typeof(ArgumentNullException))]
   public void TestThrow()
   {
       throw new ArgumentNullException();
   }</pre>
<P lang="cs">The supported decorators are:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="justify">ExceptedException, checks that an exception is thrown,</DIV>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="justify">Repeat, test repeated sequentially,</DIV>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="justify">ThreadedRepeat, test repeated on parralel threads,</DIV>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="justify">Duration, lower and upper execution duration test,</DIV>
	<LI>
		<DIV align="justify">Ignore, ignores the test</DIV>
	</LI>
</UL>
<H2 align="justify">Execution Splitting</H2>
<P>In order to have fully separated test, we create and store all the execution 
	path and attach it to some GUI. Each execution path can be attached to a 
	TreeNode for example, which makes it very easy to launch separately, or to 
	launch all tests in separate threads, etc...</P>
<P align="center"><IMG alt="Fixture" src="fixturetree.png"></P>
<p>The execution pipes are called RunPipe and are composed of a sequence of 
	RunInvoker.</p>
<H2>Framework, buillt-in fixtures</H2>
<P>GUnit already comes with a few usefull fixtures, such as the Simple Test 
	Fixture. Fixtures classes must derive from the TestFixturePatternAttribute 
	class. Execution path diagrams are automatically generated by the framework 
	using the QuickGraph and Graphviz.</P>
<p></p>
<H3>TestFixture</H3>
<P><IMG src="RunTestFixtureAttribute.png"></P>
<P>This fixture implements the Simple Test Pattern:</P>
<pre lang="cs">[TestFixture]
public class MyTest
{
    [SetUp]
    public void SetUp()
    {
        // set up the fixture
    }
    
    [Test]
    public void Test1()
    { 
       // do some test
    }
    
    [Test]
    public void Test2()
    {
      // another test
    }    
    
    [TearDown]
    public void TearDown()
    {
        // clean up
    }
}
</pre>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h3>TypeFixture</h3>
<P><IMG alt="" src="RunTypeFixtureAttribute.png"></P>
<P>This fixture applies the test to a particular type. It is highly convinient when 
	you want to write a fixture for an interface and test the interface 
	implementations. The method tagged with Provider attribute must return an 
	initialized object that is assignable with the tested type. This object is then 
	feeded to the test methods:</P>
<pre lang="cs">[TypeFixture(typeof(IList),"IList test")]
public class TypeFixtureAttributeTest
{
    [Provider(typeof(ArrayList))]
    public ArrayList ProvideArrayList()
    {
        return new ArrayList();
    }

    [Provider(typeof(ArrayList))]
    public ArrayList ProvideFilledArrayList()
    {
        ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
        list.Add("hello");
        list.Add("world");
			
        return list;
    }
				
    [Test]
    public void AddElement(IList list)
    {
        int count = list.Count;
        list.Add(null);
        Assert.AreEqual(list.Count,count+1);
    }
}
</pre>
<H3>EnumerationFixture</H3>
<P><IMG alt="" src="RunEnumerationFixtureAttribute.png"></P>
<P>This fixture implements the testing of an IEnumerable / IEnumerator 
	pair.&nbsp;The DataProvider tagged methods&nbsp;must return an enumerable 
	collection that&nbsp;will be used to populate the test IEnumerable. This lets 
	you test different scenario like the empty colleciton case, null value, 
	duplicate entries, etc... The collection is then feeded to the CopyToProvider 
	methods that must create an instance of the&nbsp;tested IEnumerable instance 
	and populate with the feeded data. The rest of the testing is done by the 
	framework:</P>
<pre lang="cs">[EnumerationFixture]
public class DictionaryEnumerationFixtureAttributeAttributeTest
{
    private Random rnd = new Random();
    private int count = 100;		
    [DataProvider(typeof(Hashtable))]
    public Hashtable HashtableData()
    {
	   Hashtable list = new Hashtable();
	    for(int i=0;i&lt;count;++i)
	       list.Add(rnd.Next(),rnd.Next());
	   return list;
    }
	
    [Provider(typeof(Hashtable))]
    public Hashtable HashtableProvider(IDictionary source)
    {
        Hashtable list = new Hashtable();
        foreach(DictionaryEntry de in source)
        {
            list.Add(de.Key,de.Value);
        }
        return list;
    }
		
    [Provider(typeof(SortedList))]
    public SortedList SortedListProvider(IDictionary source)
    {
        SortedList list = new SortedList();
        foreach(DictionaryEntry de in source)
        {
            list.Add(de.Key,de.Value);
        }
        return list;
    }
}
</pre>
<H2>Conclusions and further work</H2>
<P>GUnit is yet another way of looking at Unit testing.&nbsp;I beleive it has idea 
	that should interrested the AUT team:&nbsp;It provides enough flexibility to 
	let developer define their own fixture which makes it very powerful with 
	regards to classic framework. While there is much work to do, (a lot of unit 
	patterns to implement), GUnit already provides new type of fixtures that ease 
	up the test writer life.</P>
